	+ All monsters should save between 5-40% of the time (if using a full statblock, fill inventory with loot). Most monsters should be in the lower half of that save range. If converting, save chance should be based on evasiveness/dexterity. Since enemy dodge chance doesn't go up, attack bonuses should only be distributed to players very rarely.
	+ Player dodge chance also doesn't really go up (they can increase it, but only at a cost), so enemy attack bonuses should also all be +0 to +4.
