+ Unlike the other nations, the [[Emerem]] aren't all inhumans. Instead of entering a union with the spirits, the [[Emerem]] subjugate them and treat them more like animals.
+ [[Emerem]] go on a coming-of-age quest to capture a spirit, source of all the masks. Most capture a willing green spirit. Capturing a white spirit is a sign of a warrior's fate.
+ More details of Emerem culture are provide in the [character creation guide](web/frostbearer_character_creation.html), and aren't reproduced here.
