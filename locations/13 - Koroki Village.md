+ The Koroki princes pride themselves on being the most peaceful of the Oren elite, and refuse to take up arms. They're very smug about it.
+ They have a [[Koroki Staff of Animal Domination|magical staff]] that can control animals, and they use its power to defend their territory instead of levying warriors. In fact, owning weapons or training for war is illegal (it is a threat to their power).
+ Their village is used as a neutral meeting ground by the other Nations.
+ The prince (a woman) rides around on a white elephant.
+ Their founder is a vampire and lives under the village in a crypt.
