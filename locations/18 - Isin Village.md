+ The Isin are famed for their warrior-musicians & military strength. They've been beset on all sides for years by the [[Emerem]], and the [[Rara Bronzi]]. Recently, the [[17 - Stern of the Xyzzymandius|survivors of the Xyzzymandius]] have joined in.
+ Isin carve their masks into emoticon faces.
	+ True Monome: :/
	+ Fake Monome:  :\
+ Their prince, Monome, is shy and reclusive. Isin warriors have been agitating, calling on Monome to be brave and to strike out against their enemies. Monome decided to instead switch places with a look-alike, prince and the pauper type situation.
	+ Fake Monome is braver and more macho.
	+ Pretty much everyone knows it isn't really him, but it's so politically convenient that everyone is willing to turn a blind eye.
	+ He declared war against the tiger kingdom [[Rara Bronzi]], and won a decisive battle.
		+ The Bronzi king pled peace, and sent an outrageous pile of riches.
		+ They've arranged to marry the king's son to Monome's sister.
		+ F-Mon agreed because his advisors told him it was the right move politically (ends conflict & infertile couple can't produce claimants), but he has had a crush on the princess for years. He's jealous AF but can't act on it without giving up the ruse.
	+ But actually! The "Fake" Monome is the real prince, the two were switched at birth (also their sisters, so the princess is an imposter too, F-Mon real sister is at his old home and believes she's common).
+ Isin princes are typically sorcerers with the power to levitate stone (but it sometimes skips a generation). True Monome thought it skipped him, False Monome has this power but doesn't know it.
