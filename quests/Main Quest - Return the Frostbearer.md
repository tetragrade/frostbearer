+ The complication.
	+ The prince willingly released the [[Frostbearer]] by putting on its mask, and becoming inhuman. They're one and the same.
	+ Timeline of the Leadup to the [[Frostbearer]]'s escape.
		+ Argument Between Prince & PA.
			+ Prince initiates the discussion, talking to the Prince Apparent about his coming-of-age spirit hunt, duties as prince, etcetera.
			+ Drops the bombshell that he isn't his real father, his mother cheated with an inhuman, but promises to keep it a secret.
			+ Prince Apparent loses it, calls his mother all manner of horrible things, calls his father a cuck.
			+ Prince still loves her, starts screaming, smacks the prince apparent: <span class="text-quote">"Stupid boy!"</span>
			+ Prince apparent flees, renounces the Emerem, releases the Frostbearer.
			+ Prince's Stance.
				+ Regrets the argument immensely. 
				+ Admits that there was an argument, but denies the subject: Maintains that it was about the prince apparent's coming-of-age spirit hunt: the PA didn't want to go, that's why he smacked him, for cowardice.
			+ Prince Apparent's Stance.
				+ Fuck 'em all. I'm a spirit now, a free spirit. Spirits rule!
		+ Prince apparent sneaks out at night with his spirit team, into the spirit sanctum.
