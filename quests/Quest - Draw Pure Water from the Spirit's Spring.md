+ You are to fetch pure water from a spirit spring ([[12 - Spirit Lair]]). The water should be kept in a delicate crystal vase which breaks if dropped, and can't be placed down without spilling it.
+ But wait...
	+ The princess reveals to you in secret that it's all a sham!
	+ The princess once made the trip herself. While at the spirit's home, she gravely insulted it three times.
		1. She didn't ask politely to be let in, simply told the spirit her business.
		2. It offered her common tea, the princess told it she only drinks matcha.
		3. When the spirit showed her to the spring, she joked about bathing in the pure waters, so it kicked her out.
	+ Every since, it has refused entry to Pereken water seekers (unless she apologises, and she won't).
	+ She tells you to just go fill it with water from the glacier, nobody can tell the difference.
	+ But if you could steal some water from the spirit's pure spring, that'd be even better, and she'll give you an even greater reward.
+ Reward:
	+ 3 Bottle Wine (20d R&B).
	+ 1 Green Spirit Mask (expert at preparing any kind of drink)
	+ 1 Green Spirit Mask (expert at provoking people into rash action).
	+ If you *claim* to be bringing real pure water (so long as it's from the glacier, she can't tell the difference either):
		+ 1 [[Sorcerous River Rod]]. ![[Sorcerous River Rod]]
+ The water will be used by Pereken elites for a tea ritual that is central to an important festival.
