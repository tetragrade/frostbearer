+ The Magisterials brought a special device that they can use to locate Ignitean relics. It was lost when the [[17 - Stern of the Xyzzymandius|Xyzzy]] went down. [[Captain Kyrus]] wants it back.
+ It was last seen in the hold, in the stern. The stern broke off and went down somewhere to the west ([[G2 - Stern of the Xyzzymandius]]).
+ Reward:
	+ Anything you bring back, we'll let you keep half. But you must bring the locators first.
		+ If you try to steal from us, the Magisterium will take it back in time! That's not a threat, merely a warning.
	+ We'll give you one if you agree to help us look for [[Ignitean Complex|Ignitean]] tech.
