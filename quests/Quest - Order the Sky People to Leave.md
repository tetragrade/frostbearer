+ [[Forward Monome|Prince Monome]] of the [[18 - Isin Village|Isin]] is looking for a neutral party to settle a dispute with the [[17 - Stern of the Xyzzymandius|survivors aboard the Xyzzymandius]].
+ Here are his demands:<br><span class="text-quote">
	  Prince of the Sky people, you will now behold the demands of the Wise and Mighty Prince of the Isin Nation!<br>
	  1. You will send me one sorcerer as a hostage, to teach me the ways of magic.<br>
	  2. You will fix your boat and fly off immediately. Never return!<br>
	  3. You will accept my delegates, two of my finest musicians, who will return to your homeland to serve your king.
	</span>
+ The Intent:
	+ Mutual hostage taking is a common political move among the Oren, and this is the usual polite way of phrasing it.
	+ This is a very polite and generous offer, which guarantees the [[Magisterium Magnifica|Magisterials]] the right to retreat, and gives them more hostages than the [[18 - Isin Village|Isin]].<br>Although, the prince is also trying to sneak in a trick: he's trading two prestigious people for a practical advisor, something the [[18 - Isin Village|Isin]] are in dire need of. 
	+ The expectation is that the Xyzzy crew will send a near-identical counter offer naming the wizard as a delegate, and the musicians as hostages, which the prince will accept.
+ [[Captain Kyrus]] has no understanding nor interest in any of this, and will take these demands as evidence that the Isin are trying to kill them.
+ Reward:
	+ 1 Favour ([[Forward Monome|Prince Monome]]).
	+ 1 [[Cloak of Kanoko the Great Sage of the Canopy]] ![[Cloak of Kanoko the Great Sage of the Canopy]]
	+ [[Forward Monome|Prince Monome]] will have a giant statue of you carved into the [[18 - Isin Village|Isin]] hall of heroes.

+ [[Forward Monome|Monome]] is confident the [[Magisterium Magnifica|Magisterials]] will agree, so the reward is just for delivering the letter.
+ If the demands are refused he'll try to reward characters with a mundane cloak instead (worth 50d R&B), arguing that he misspoke. 
+ This violates a convention { Princes Must Never Break Their Oaths (d10) }, and is VERY unpopular with his people.
