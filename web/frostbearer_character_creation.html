			<h1>Frostbearer Character Creation Guide</h1>
			<p>
				<!--
				TODO: Intro text here explaining the module pitch, chaos has befallen the forest!
				Hexmap with stuff
				Player fantasy pitch, discovering secrets and conspiracy. 
				-->
				
				The module is a small but dense hexcrawl, set in a rainforest. An ancient evil has recently awoken, kidnapped the prince, and threatens to end the forest in icy oblivion!
				<br>
				Will our brave heroes storm the Fortress of the Frostbearer and defeat the evil? You decide!
				<br>
				
				This an extended playtest for my system <a href="https://github.com/tetragrade/veracity-ttrpg">Veracity TTRPG</a>. The gameplay involves OSR dungeon-crawling and faction play,
				but with an emphasis on learning and revealing secrets, exposing lies & conspiracies.
				<br>
				
				The plan is to run the campaign for at least ten weeks guaranteed, every Saturday at 16:00 UTC. I may also run other slots, depending on interest and availability.
				After ten weeks, the Frostbearer's influence unbalances the environment and it will begin to collapse. After that: at the end of each session, there's a 1-in-6 chance that it destroys all life in the forest. This ends the campaign.
